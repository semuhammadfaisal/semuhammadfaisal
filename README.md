# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Muhammad Faisal

### I build digital experiences that live on the web

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** who enjoys bringing ideas to life in the browser. I love that moment when code transforms into something people can actually use and enjoy.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech, reading about design, or figuring out how to make things work better.
